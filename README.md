# ha-toyota-na

## Introduction
This is a Home Assistant integration for Toyota and Lexus connected services in
North America. This personal fork builds on [orienw/ha-toyota-na](https://github.com/orienw/ha-toyota-na),
which builds on [widewing/ha-toyota-na](https://github.com/widewing/ha-toyota-na).

The current beta improves remote-command failure handling and diagnostics.
See [remote-command changes and validation](docs/remote-command-beta.md).
Vehicle operation has not yet been verified with this beta.

Report problems and request features in [this fork's issue tracker](https://github.com/sitapix/ha-toyota-na/issues).

## Vehicle support

Supported generations: `17CY`, `17CYPLUS`, `21MM`, `24MM`, `26BEV`, and `NG86`.
`GR86` support is experimental and needs owner testing.

This fork adds:

* 24MM and 26BEV status and remote commands through Toyota's AppSync service
* 21MM remote commands through Toyota's newer command route
* NG86 vehicles, plus experimental GR86 support
* More remote controls, charging and climate settings, and schedules, offered
  only where the vehicle reports support

To check a vehicle's generation, download diagnostics from the Toyota
integration under **Settings > Devices & services**. Each vehicle's
`generation` is listed under `vehicle_list`.

## Installation
Requires Home Assistant 2024.11 or newer.

### HACS

If you already use the upstream integration, follow [Switching from upstream](#switching-from-upstream) first.

[![Open this repository in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=sitapix&repository=ha-toyota-na&category=integration)

Use the button above, or add the repository manually:

1. Open HACS, select the three-dot menu, then **Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/sitapix/ha-toyota-na` with type **Integration**.
3. Open this fork's entry and select **Download**. Choose the latest version on
   the [releases page](https://github.com/sitapix/ha-toyota-na/releases).
   If that release is a prerelease, enable beta versions in HACS.
4. Restart Home Assistant, then add **Toyota (North America)** under
   **Settings > Devices & services**.

To get beta releases, open this repository's device under the HACS
integration, enable its **Pre-release** switch, and turn it on. HACS then
offers beta updates.

### Switching from upstream

This fork keeps the `toyota_na` domain and your existing account, device, and
entity IDs. Leave the Toyota entry in place under **Settings > Devices &
services** so configuration and automations stay put.

1. In **HACS**, open the downloaded entry for `orienw/ha-toyota-na` (or `widewing/ha-toyota-na`) and select
   **Remove** from its three-dot menu. HACS removes the component files and
   leaves the Home Assistant data.
2. Add `https://github.com/sitapix/ha-toyota-na` as a custom repository with type
   **Integration**.
3. Download this fork's latest stable release. Finish the download before you
   restart Home Assistant.
4. Restart Home Assistant, then open the Toyota integration and confirm
   vehicles and entities are still there.

Confirm HACS lists `sitapix/ha-toyota-na` as downloaded. Both repositories
install to `custom_components/toyota_na`, so only one can be installed at a
time.

On vehicles with a tailgate, this integration replaces the trunk entities with
Tailgate and Tailgate Lock. Update any automations that still reference the
trunk entities.

### Manual installation

1. Download `ha_toyota_na.zip` from the latest release on the [releases page](https://github.com/sitapix/ha-toyota-na/releases).
2. Extract its contents into `custom_components/toyota_na` in your Home Assistant
   configuration directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant. For a new install, add **Toyota (North America)**
   under **Settings > Devices & services**. For an existing install, keep the
   configured Toyota entry.

## Configuration
Add **Toyota (North America)** under **Settings > Devices & services**. Enter
your username and password, then the verification code sent to your email or
phone.

Apple, Google, and Facebook sign-in are not supported. If your Toyota account
uses one of them, sign out of the Toyota app and sign in with the same email
address that Apple, Google, or Facebook uses, then tap **Forgot password** to
set a password. Sign in here with that email and password.

Use **Configure** to choose how vehicle status is updated. Home Assistant
always reads Toyota's cloud data. That data stays unchanged until the
vehicle contacts Toyota. Choose **Cloud updates only** to skip scheduled
wakes. Refresh Status and remote commands stay available. Pick an interval
to wake the vehicle.

## Current features

Available sensors and controls depend on the vehicle and Toyota account.
Cached readings can work without Remote Connect if Toyota grants access.
Remote commands and vehicle wake requests need remote access.

Not every vehicle reports every item below.

Sensors:

* Door Lock Status

* Flash Hazards button
* Find Vehicle button
* Horn, headlights, and buzzer buttons
* Open/close windows, close sunroof, and cargo-door controls
* Refresh Status button
* Charge Now, Resume Charging, and Stop Charging buttons
* Saved climate temperature, fan speed, airflow, and seat preferences
* Defroster, steering-wheel heat, recirculation, and longer climate runtime preferences
* Use Climate Settings switch
* Charge limit, AC current, DC power, and power supply battery limit
* Stop Power Supply button, while external power is active
* Enable/disable switches for saved multi-day charge schedules

The main lock reports the vehicle's door locks, like the Doors tile in Toyota's
app. Check cargo sensors separately in automations that monitor whether the
whole vehicle is secured; on vehicles with a tailgate, use Tailgate Lock.

Climate preferences for Remote Start appear under device configuration.
Remote Start runs the engine or climate system the vehicle supports.
Charging settings and buttons follow the vehicle's reported options and state.
The charge limit remains selectable when Toyota explicitly reports support but
omits the current target; its current value stays Unknown until reported.

The Charge Schedules sensor lists saved schedules in its attributes.
`toyota_na.set_charge_schedule` creates a schedule (start, end, days of the
week) or updates named fields when you pass a schedule ID. Times are the
vehicle's local time. `toyota_na.delete_charge_schedule` removes a schedule by
ID. While eco charging is on, Toyota's app locks manual schedules, so enabling
one here with its switch or `set_charge_schedule` can conflict with eco charging.

Like Toyota's app, climate schedules are available on climate-capable 24MM and
newer vehicles and on electric vehicles other than 17CY and NG86. The Climate
Schedules sensor lists saved preconditioning reservations and their temperature
range. Use `toyota_na.set_climate_schedule` with a start time, temperature, and
either a date or repeating days to create one. Pass a schedule ID to edit selected fields;
existing seat and defroster options are preserved. Each schedule has an on/off
switch, and `toyota_na.delete_climate_schedule` removes it.

Climate schedule dates and times use Home Assistant's configured timezone.
Toyota stores these reservations in UTC. Like Toyota's app, the Climate Schedules
sensor shows a repeating schedule at the UTC offset of the date its time was
last set, so it keeps the same displayed time after daylight saving time
changes. Check that the first run after a change starts when expected. If it
runs an hour off, set its time again. Charge schedule times continue to use the
vehicle's local time.

### Sensor display

Plug Status and Connector Status show readable charging and connection states.
Unrecognized values show Unknown; Toyota's original value is in `raw_value`.
Last Update Timestamp and Last Tire Pressure Update Timestamp show dates and
times. Choose km/h or mph in the Speed sensor's settings.

Remaining Charge Time shows Unknown when Toyota has no estimate. Unplugging
the vehicle clears Charging Status.

### Removing a vehicle

After you remove a vehicle from the Toyota account, delete its device under
**Settings > Devices & services**. The integration checks the account first.
Vehicles Toyota still lists cannot be deleted this way.
